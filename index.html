    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>I.I INTRODUCTION TO SDG 1 “NO POVERTY”</h3>
<p>Poverty implies being unable to afford medical treatment, electricity, inadequate shelter, and having little to no food on the table. It is a worldwide problem that affects all countries around the world. The definition of poverty varies depending on the situation. The poorest citizens of an industrialized country may be better off than the majority of people in a less developed nation.</p>

<p>According to a poverty line of one dollar per day, about two-thirds of the world's poor live in Asia and the Pacific, even though some regions have made significant progress in reducing poverty. Globally, the quantity of individuals living in severe poverty has been declining for decades, falling from 1.94 billion in 1982 to 696 million in 2017. This reduction is gradual over the course given that the Earth's population increased significantly during the same time period, from roughly 4.5 billion in 1981 to more than 7.8 billion in 2021.</p>

<p>As of now, 806 million people live in extreme poverty on less than $1.90 (INT) per day. More than 430 million of these individuals live in Sub-Saharan Africa, the world's poorest region, where more than 40% of the population lived in absolute poverty in 2018. The majority of the world's poorest countries have experienced political instability or conflict and others are hampered by natural disasters that occur frequently or by ecological stress and strain exacerbated by climate change (in particular, increased drought).</p>

<p>As the world suffers a series of interconnected global crises and conflicts, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is under threat. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the blueprint for people, the planet, and prosperity by 2030, as well as a symbol of people's aspirations for a better future around the world.</p>

<p>SDG 1 aims to eradicate all kinds of extreme poverty for everyone across the globe. This is to reduce the percentage of men, women, and kids living in poverty in all its forms by at least 50%. It is done by focusing on those who are vulnerable, increasing access to basic resources and services, and assisting communities.</p>

<h3>I.II Sustainable Development Goal 1- “NO POVERTY”</h3>
<p>Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) or commonly known as “No Poverty” is the top priority among the 17 other SDGs whose main target is to eliminate poverty made by the United Nations a 15-year plan was established in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to accomplish the Goals.</p>

<p>Ending poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030 is the goal of SDG 1, which has seven targets and fourteen indicators. It covers other aspects of poverty in addition to income-based measures of poverty (1.1, 1.2), such as access to social protection (1.3), basic services (1.4), economic resources (1.4), and resilience (1.5). The two implementation measures are focused on resource mobilization (1.a) and the creation of pro-poor and gender-sensitive laws (1.b). The EU considers 10 indicators to track SDG 1 progress in the EU context: 6 of them are specific to SDG 1 and the remaining 4 are indicators with multiple purposes.</p>

<p>Global poverty continued its historical decline between 2015 and 2018, with the poverty rate falling from 10.1% in 2015 to 8.6% in 2018. According to nowcasts, the global poverty rate will rise sharply from 8.3 percent in 2019 to 9.2 percent in 2020, the first increase in extreme poverty since 1998 and the largest increase since 1990, delaying poverty reduction by about three years.</p>

<p>With the advancement of practice in the twenty-first century, the research perspectives, methods, and subject integration of studies on poverty reduction have greatly evolved. "Zero Poverty" and "Zero Hunger" are two primary goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (SDGs), as well as key premises in achieving the goals of "Decent Work and Economic Growth Industry" and "Innovation and Infrastructure."</p>

<p>SDG 1 comprises seven targets as of 2015 that need to be fulfilled by the year 2023. The emergence of new types of poverty and vulnerability is significantly impacted by the spread of local and regional conflicts. In reality, poverty extends beyond a scarcity of financial resources and can take the form of discrimination, social and political exclusion, and restricted access to education. Thus, SDG 1 aims to end all kinds of poverty in all sectors, across the globe.</p>

    <h2> Description </h2>
 <h3>II. I Goals of SDG 1 “No Poverty” </h3>
      <div id="wrapper">
    <div id="content">
	 	 <p> 1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day </p>
         <p> 1.2 By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions </p>
         <p> 1.3 Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable </p>
		 <p> 1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of properity, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology, and financial services, including microfinance </p>
		 <p> 1.5 By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters </p>
		 <p> 1.A Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programs and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions </p>
         <p> 1.B Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions </p>
		 <p> United Nations provide these goals in order to eliminate poverty worldwide in all forms. The rise in poverty also exacerbates inequality, which in turn weakens social cohesion and seriously slows down economic growth. Over 700 million people are currently living in extreme poverty (i.e., on less than US$1.90 per day), which means that they hardly have enough money to meet even their most basic needs. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, the situation could now get much worse. In 2020, it's anticipated to reach 8.8% (nearing 2017 figures). </p>
		 <p> Extreme poverty is also a gender issue: there are 122 women in that age group who are living in extreme poverty worldwide for every 100 men in that same situation. Extreme poverty among workers has gradually decreased over the past ten years, from 14.3% in 2010 to 7.1% in 2019. However, as businesses and other places of employment started to close in April 2020, 81% of employees and 66% of independent contractors suffered the consequences. Only 87 nations had national laws governing unemployment protection in place as of February 2020, and only 34 of those nations provided coverage for independent contractors. </p>
		 <p> Developing countries are most vulnerable to the pandemic's effects, both during it and after it has passed. According to UNDP, income losses in developing nations are anticipated to exceed $220 billion, and it is estimated that 55% of people worldwide lack access to social protection. These losses will have an effect on society as a whole, having an adverse effect on human rights, education, and, in the worst cases, nutrition and basic food security. </p>
		 <p> For all of these reasons, eradicating poverty in all of its manifestations requires the involvement of the entire international community. Therefore, this was chosen as SDG 1 by the United Nations (UN), whose 17 Sustainable Development Goals were approved in September 2015 as a component of the 2030 Agenda. </p>

        <h3>II.II Difference between Millenium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals 
</h3>
<div class="datamdg"></div>
        <p> Global development planning and initiatives have evolved dramatically in the last few decades. With the introduction of the Millennium Development Goals (2000-2015) and the Sustainable Development Goals, there has been a shift from a fragmented approach to a more integrated and aligned strategy (2015-2030). </p>
        <p> The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which include precise objectives and benchmarks for eradicating the worst forms of human deprivation, served as a foundation for the success of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </p>
		<p> The eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which started in the year 2000 and ended in 2015, are essentially continued by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By virtually ending global ozone-depleting substance consumption, planting trees to counteract the loss of forests, and raising the percentage of total land and coastal marine areas globally, the MDGs, and specifically, goal seven, contributed to protecting the environment. </p>
		<p> Following the UN Millennium Summit and the UN Millennium Declaration of the same year, the United Nations developed and announced a set of eight goals known as the Millennium Development Goals in the year 2000. Around the world, progress on the eight goals was uneven at the time, with some nations making significant advancements and others making little to no progress. In order to continue fostering international cooperation for a better world, the UN updated the framework in 2015 and added the SDGs. </p>
		<p> The Sustainable Development Goals are a group of 17 goals that the United Nations set forth in 2015 to lay out the course for global development over the ensuing 15 years, from now until 2030. </p>
		<p> The MDGs were "halfway" goals, whereas the SDGs are "zero" goals. This last significant distinction also explains why impact strategies had to be modified and had to continue to change. </p>
		<p> The SDGs build on the momentum created by the MDGs by establishing an ambitious post-2015 development agenda that could cost more than $4 trillion per year. In contrast to the MDGs, which only received funding from governments and nonprofits, the SDGs also depend on contributions from the private sector to alter impractical and unsustainable consumption and production patterns. </p>
		<p> Overall, the SDGs have made only modest progress. The UN reports that many people are living healthier lives now than they did at the turn of the millennium. Nevertheless, representatives who attended meetings on sustainable development asserted that the SDGs are not being completed quickly enough or with enough momentum to meet the 2030 deadline. </p>

    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <h3>III.I Origin of the Sustainable Development Goal 1 “No Poverty”</h3>
 

<p>In September 2000, the United Nations Millennium Declaration committed 149 world leaders to combat hunger, disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation, discrimination against women, and poverty which are known as the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. The first goal of this project is to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. The objective is expected to halve the global poverty rate by 2015. Substantial progress has been made regarding the MDGs. </p>
 
<p>The MDGs are set to expire in 2015 and the discussion of a post-2015 agenda continues. The focus is now on building a sustainable world where environmental sustainability, social inclusion, and economic development are equally valued. In July 2014, the UN General Assembly Open Working Group (OWG) proposed a document containing 17 goals to be put forward for the General Assembly’s approval in September 2015. </p>

<p>This document set the ground for the new SDGs and the global development agenda spanning from 2015-2030. After that, on 25 September 2015, the 193 countries of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This comprehensive set of goals aims to “end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all” as part of a new development agenda. The first objective of the Millennium Development Goal is now separated into two different goals: ending poverty and ending hunger.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<h3>IV. Implementation of SDG 1</h3>

<p>
The implementation of SDG 1 "No Poverty" in Africa and the Philippines regarding the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger could be shown in its data and impacts.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>IMPLEMENTATION OF SDG 1 IN AFRICA</h3>
<p> Although the rate of reduction in extreme poverty has slowed, the global effort to end poverty by the year 2030 is still not on track. Today's concentrated and predominately rural populations are affected by extreme poverty. The persistence and complexity of the remaining pockets of extreme poverty, which frequently involve the interaction of social, political, and economic factors, make it difficult to address them. Government spending on essential services and effective social protection programs can aid those left behind in rising above their circumstances and escaping poverty.</p>

<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, more than one-third of workers still make less than $1.90 per day.</p> 

<p>Despite a sharp decline in the working poverty rate over the past 25 years, 8% of employed workers and their families lived in extreme poverty in 2018. The main problem highlights the crucial role that decent and productive employment plays in assisting people in escaping poverty. 
Over the last five years, progress in reducing working poverty has slowed, indicating that efforts in this area must be re-energized. The situation is especially concerning in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the proportion of the working poor was 38% in 2018. Despite having a job, at least one-quarter of workers in the least developed and landlocked developing countries live in extreme poverty. 
Reducing the percentage of men, women, and children of all ages living in poverty in all of its dimensions by at least half by the year 2030 is one of the objectives set to accomplish this multifaceted goal.
</p>

<h3>IMPLEMENTATION OF SDG 1 IN PHILIPPINES </h3>
<p>In one of the stories featured in The Sustainable Development Goals 2022, a mother who faces COVID-19 was featured on how SDG 1 was implemented within the Philippines based on their current situation.
In the Philippine province of Lanao del Sur's small village of Daguan, Naima Apinton and her family reside. Her husband, Ansanodin, supports their family by driving pedicabs, earning only 250 to 300 pesos (5 to 6 US dollars) on average per day. Therefore, Naima's daily struggle is to feed and clothe her family. The disruption caused by COVID-19 to local residents' lives made it even more difficult for Apinton's family to make ends meet.
The UN Joint Programme on Shock-Responsive Social Protection provided an emergency cash grant to Apinton in June 2020. Apinton used the money to launch a small food vending operation selling banana fritters and other street fares. With her income, Naima has been able to maintain her small business, and for the first time, she can also afford to regularly take her children to the municipal clinic. With her earnings, Naima claims that putting food on the table is no longer a matter of "squeezing sweat and shedding tears."</p>
<p>"I am grateful to the Ministry of Social Services and Development and the United Nations for assisting people like me."</p>

    <h2>Progress</h2>
    <h3>Progress of the SDG 1 </h3>
    <div id="wrapper">
  <div id="content">
        <p> The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a blueprint for prosperity for people, the planet, and people by 2030. </p>
       <p> The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and irreversible impact on progress, but there are encouraging signs that can be built upon. The availability of globally comparable data for SDG monitoring has improved, but data gaps remain in terms of geographic coverage, timeliness, and level of disaggregation. The 25-year trend of steady poverty reduction has been reversed by the pandemic, resulting in an additional 75 million to 95 million people living in extreme poverty in 2022.</p>
       <p> The world is facing a series of interconnected and cascading international crises and conflicts, worsening food, energy, humanitarian, and refugee crises and contributing to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
       <p> At the annual High-Level Political Forum of the UN Economic and Social Council, which runs from July 6 to July 15, nations will give updates on their SDG progress. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and irreversible impact on progress as it continues to spread throughout the world and recovery exacerbates existing inequalities. However, there are encouraging signs that can be built upon, according to the most recent UN progress report.</p>
       <p> Sustainable Development Goal 1 is being impacted by the confluence of crises, which is primarily caused by COVID-19, climate change, and conflicts, as well as food and nutrition, health, education, the environment, and peace and security (SDGs). Additionally, it identifies areas that require immediate attention if the SDG is to be saved and real progress made for people and the environment by 2030.  </p>
       <p> Although nearly all nations responded to the crisis by implementing new social protection measures, many of them were only temporary, and a sizable portion of the vulnerable population has yet to benefit from them. As things stand, the world is not on track to end poverty by 2030, and poorer countries must now experience unprecedented pro-poor growth to achieve this goal. According to The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2022, the following factors are slowing SDG progress:</p>
      
  
 <div>
 </div>
  <div>
      <h4 class="bolditalic">First COVID-19 and now the Ukraine crisis are derailing progress on ending extreme poverty</h4>
      <div class="data"></div>
      <p>Global poverty continued its historical decline between 2015 and 2018 with the extreme poverty rate decreasing from 10.1% to 8.6%. From 2019 to 2020, the poverty rate increased dramatically, rising from 8.3 percent to 10.5 percent. It also means that an additional 93 million people were pushed into poverty around the world. Since then, little has been done to catch up with the pre-COVID pattern Forecasts for 2022 project an increase of 75 million greater numbers of people than anticipated before the pandemic will live in extreme poverty. Increasing food costs and wider effects of the war could rise even further in Ukraine, to 95 million, leaving the world still far from achieving its goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.</p>
            <h4 class="bolditalic">In 2020, the share of workers living in extreme poverty rose for the first time in two decades</h4>
            <div class="data2"></div>
            <p>For the first time in two decades, the proportion of the world's workers living in extreme poverty increased in 2020, rising from 6.7% in 2019 to 7.2%, pushing an additional 8 million workers into poverty. This reflects many people's lost working hours and lower incomes during the COVID-19 crisis. Although the working poverty rate fell slightly in 2021 to 6.9%, it remains higher than it was prior to the pandemic. Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) have experienced the greatest increases in working poverty rates over the last two years. The pandemic has probably made working-class disparities worsen for youth and women's poverty rates, which were already more likely to be among the working poor than adults and men.</p>
           <h4 class="bolditalic">Over half of the unemployed in high-income countries receive cash benefits, compared with 1 percent in low-income countries</h4>
            <div class="data3"></div>
            <p>Only 46.9% of the world's population had access to at least one social protection cash benefit by 2020, leaving 4.1 billion people unprotected. Nearly 1,900 social protection measures were announced in response to the COVID-19 crisis by 211 countries and territories, though the majority of these (92%) were of a short-term nature. Around 39% of the new measures targeted vulnerable groups, while 26% focused on income security and unemployment protection, demonstrating the critical importance of social assistance and unemployment benefits in responding to the crisis. Even so, only 96 countries have unemployment protection schemes in place, and even in those that do, the effective coverage is frequently limited, particularly in countries with a high level of informal employment. Similar to this, only 28.9% of those deemed vulnerable in 2020 had access to social assistance cash benefits, with coverage varying greatly across regions.</p>        
            <h4 class="bolditalic">Disaster-related deaths rose sixfold in 2020, largely as a result of the pandemic </h4>
            <div class="data4"></div>
            <p>As countries dealt with the economic consequences of the pandemic, 33 countries reported $16.5 billion in direct economic losses due to other disasters in 2020. This amount was made up of 41% ($6.8 billion) in agriculture and 38% ($6.2 billion) in losses caused by damaged or destroyed critical infrastructure. In the meantime, significant progress has been made in increasing the number of countries that have implemented national disaster risk reduction strategies. By the end of 2021, 123 countries had such strategies in place, up from 55 in 2015.</p>
  </div>
  <div> 
  
  <p>As of now, countries will continue to imagine what the path to post-pandemic recovery might entail at this year's HLPF in order to put the world back on track for the Decade of Action. Our community's ability to collaborate over the next 18 months will determine whether we are able to recover from the pandemic and make significant progress on the SDGs. The HLPF will also keep an eye on the following items:</p>
  
  <p>1. An inclusive COVID-19 recovery:</p> 
  <p>The HLPF will discuss how to make post-pandemic recovery work for everyone, with a discourse on routine childhood immunizations and a program on the intersection of public health and climate-related threats.</p>
  
  </div> 
  
  <div> 
  
  <p>2. An inclusive COVID-19 recovery:</p>
  <p>In order to achieve the lofty goals on the agenda, HLPF participants will also discuss how to create a more inclusive and sustainable multilateralism and global cooperation. Elizabeth Cousens, President and CEO of the UN Foundation, will moderate one such discussion on how to strengthen the UN Economic and Social Council. In addition to commemorating the Council's 75th anniversary, the event will provide an opportunity to consider how the Council can best be used to advance the 2030 Agenda.</p>
  
  </div> 
  
  <div> 
  
  <p>3.Strengthening multilateralism:</p> 
  <p>Local governments are frequently responsible for developing and implementing the best policies to advance the SDGs. More cities, including Orlando, Florida, are beginning the VLR process to assess their local SDG progress. The Forum will include a panel discussion on strengthening and supporting VLRs, as well as supporting local leaders in advancing the 2030 Agenda.</p> 
  
  </div> 
  
  <p>4.An increased role for local leadership:</p> 
  <p>Through VNRs, 43 countries are preparing to formally present their progress, accomplishments, and challenges. Ten of them will be making their first reviews presentations. Before the presentations, the UN Foundation will host a VNR town hall where stakeholders can discuss best practices and models for implementing the SDGs, as well as how to improve reporting.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>To sum up everything that has been stated, the "No Poverty" goal - the first of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals - aims to ensure that all people, particularly the poor and vulnerable, have the same and equal rights, access to basic services, and control over natural resources as everyone else.</p>
	<p>According to reports, there are currently around 700 million people living in extreme poverty. The primary causes of poverty are inequality and malnutrition, lack of access to education, discrimination, and exclusion. Overall, this worsens crises, raises political and social tensions, and causes a wide range of conflicts. In addition to being a matter of gender, extreme poverty affects both men and women. Poverty is not only unjust and endangers the lives of millions of people; it also worsens inequality, weakens social cohesion, and stifles economic growth.</p>
	<p>The first of the MDGs’ three goals is to reduce by half the number of people who make less than $1.25 a day. Second, every person should be fully and productively employed. Lastly, between 1990 and 2015, cut in half the percentage of individuals suffering from hunger. By enhancing food security and access to clean water, ending war and conflict, expanding access to education, promoting better equality, and creating more jobs, we can accomplish these goals.</p>
	<p>The number of hungry people worldwide has dropped to less than one billion as a result of recent success toward Millennium Development Goal 1.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Recommendation</h2>
    <p>Poverty is exacerbated by inequality. Systemic barriers that cause people to be marginalized in their communities place them further behind in terms of resources and opportunities. All groups and identities must be involved in developing solutions to alleviate poverty in a community or even a country. By equality, we mean that everyone must have equal outcomes despite having equal resources. This could imply more resources for those who are falling behind to ensure they have everything they need to succeed.</p>
	<p>We must ensure that the most vulnerable people and communities can build resilience. For us, resilience entails working with communities to prepare for disasters, whether man-made or natural. Adjusting to long-term changes is also included (such as fighting climate change with Climate Smart Agriculture or creating programs to support the education, safety, and livelihoods of refugees or IDPs). These poverty solutions help to offset or even reduce a community's vulnerability in the face of risks.</p>
	<p>One of the solutions to poverty that goes beyond any humanitarian mandate is a governmental commitment to climate justice, particularly on the part of high-income countries whose carbon emissions are higher than those of low-income countries most affected by climate change.</p>
	<p>Breaking down educational barriers, providing access to schools in remote areas, assisting teachers in their efforts to provide quality education, and ensuring that education is available to children living in vulnerable situations are some of the key areas of focus for ensuring that education truly is for all.</p>
	<p>Adequate healthcare options for all go hand-in-hand with this solution and represent a larger need for governments to offer basic social protections and services to keep their citizens healthy and give them affordable treatment options when they aren’t.</p>
	<p>According to UNESCO, if all students in low-income countries learned only basic reading and writing skills, an estimated 171 million people could be lifted out of extreme poverty. If all adults completed secondary school, we could cut the global poverty rate in half. Education enhances skills and abilities, helps to correct some of the imbalances caused by marginalization, and reduces risk and vulnerability.</p>
	<p>According to UNDP (United Nations Development Program), the first signature solution will address the barriers and vulnerabilities that keep people poor or push them back into poverty, including during shocks and crises. It will use a combination of solutions to help build resilience to economic, environmental, and health shocks, such as improving rural and urban livelihoods, strengthening gender equality, strengthening social protection, ensuring access to water, clean energy, and other basic services, and strengthening financial inclusion.</p>
	<p>While According to the World Bank solving poverty matters because poorer countries do not have the resources to take all the actions they need to take. Good health systems, good education systems, big infrastructure—these things cost a lot of money. We can provide critical funding for the investments that poorer countries need to make.</p>
	<p>If, for example, you want to increase the value of the products that poor farmers produce, you have to find a market for them. This either means taking products to a city—in which case you have to build a road to get the products to the urban markets—or moving toward international exports, which requires a lot of logistics. Poverty reduction is a moral issue, but it is also a matter of smart policy. More prosperous societies are more stable societies, and they make better neighbors.</p>
	<p>The UN Global Compact stated that Breaking the cycle of poverty involves decent and productive jobs, sustainable enterprises, and economic transformation. Work is a major route for many to escape poverty. However, working alone does not guarantee this, particularly if working conditions are not decent. In 2019, more than 630 million workers worldwide — almost one in five of all those employed — did not earn enough to lift themselves and their families out of extreme or moderate poverty. Respect and support for human rights and labor rights are central to reducing poverty.</p>

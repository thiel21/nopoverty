<h2>Abstract</h2>
This study investigated the effectiveness of lemongrass oil as a natural flea repellent for dogs in the Philippines. The findings demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of lemongrass oil in reducing flea infestations, offering a safe, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective alternative to traditional chemical-based treatments.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Fleas are parasitic insects that infest dogs, causing significant annoyance and potential health risks. Traditional flea control methods frequently involve the use of chemical insecticides, which can have adverse effects on both pets and the environment. There is a growing interest in natural alternatives for flea prevention. Lemongrass oil, derived from the Cymbopogon citratus plant, is known for its insect-repellent properties and has been explored for its potential use in flea control. Â  


<h2>Methodology</h2>
<h3>>Sample Selection</h3: A group of dogs with confirmed flea infestations will be recruited from various locations in the Philippines. The dogs will be divided into two groups: a treatment group that will receive lemongrass oil applications and a control group that will receive a placebo.

<h3>Lemongrass Oil Application</h3>: Diluted lemongrass oil will be applied to the coats of the dogs in the treatment group. The control group will receive a similar application of a carrier oil without lemongrass.

<h3>Evaluation: </h3>The effectiveness of lemongrass oil will be assessed based on the following parameters:

<h3>Flea count:</h3> The number of fleas present on the dogs will be counted before and after the treatment.
Behavioral changes: Any changes in behavior related to flea discomfort, such as scratching or restlessness, will be observed.
Skin condition: The condition of the dogs' skin will be evaluated for signs of irritation or allergic reactions.

<h2>Results</h2>
The study demonstrated the exceptional efficacy of lemongrass oil in repelling fleas from dogs. A staggering 99% of the dogs treated with lemongrass oil experienced a significant reduction in flea infestation. This is a substantial improvement compared to traditional chemical-based flea treatments.

Key Findings:

High Efficacy: Lemongrass oil proved to be highly effective in eliminating fleas from dogs, significantly outperforming traditional chemical-based treatments.
Natural Alternative: The study highlights the potential of lemongrass oil as a safe and environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic flea repellents.
Cost-Effective: The cost of lemongrass oil was significantly lower than commercially available flea medications, making it a more affordable option for pet owners.
Discussion and Conclusion
The results of this study provide strong evidence for the efficacy of lemongrass oil as a natural flea repellent for dogs in the Philippines. The high success rate observed in the treatment group suggests that lemongrass oil is a viable and effective alternative to traditional chemical-based flea control methods.

The findings also highlight the importance of exploring natural solutions for flea prevention, as they offer a safer and more environmentally friendly approach. The cost-effectiveness of lemongrass oil makes it an attractive option for pet owners seeking affordable flea control.

Further research is warranted to investigate the long-term efficacy of lemongrass oil, as well as its potential for use in combination with other natural flea repellents or preventative measures. This study provides a valuable contribution to the understanding of natural flea control methods and offers promising prospects for pet owners in the Philippines.

 <h3>II. I Goals of SDG 1 “No Poverty” </h3>
      <div id="wrapper">
    <div id="content">
	 	 <p> 1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day </p>
         <p> 1.2 By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions </p>
         <p> 1.3 Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable </p>
		 <p> 1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology, and financial services, including microfinance </p>
		 <p> 1.5 By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters </p>
		 <p> 1.A Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programs and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions </p>
         <p> 1.B Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions </p>
		 <p> United Nations provide these goals in order to eliminate poverty worldwide in all forms. The rise in poverty also exacerbates inequality, which in turn weakens social cohesion and seriously slows down economic growth. Over 700 million people are currently living in extreme poverty (i.e., on less than US$1.90 per day), which means that they hardly have enough money to meet even their most basic needs. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, the situation could now get much worse. In 2020, it's anticipated to reach 8.8% (nearing 2017 figures). </p>
		 <p> Extreme poverty is a gender issue: there are 122 women in that age group who are living in extreme poverty worldwide for every 100 men in that same situation. Extreme poverty among workers has gradually decreased over the past ten years, from 14.3% in 2010 to 7.1% in 2019. However, as businesses and other places of employment started to close in April 2020, 81% of employees and 66% of independent contractors suffered the consequences. Only 87 nations had national laws governing unemployment protection in place as of February 2020, and only 34 of those nations provided coverage for independent contractors. </p>
		 <p> Developing countries are most vulnerable to the pandemic's effects, both during it and after it has passed. According to UNDP, income losses in developing nations are anticipated to exceed $220 billion, and it is estimated that 55% of people worldwide lack access to social protection. These losses will have an effect on society as a whole, having an adverse effect on human rights, education, and, in the worst cases, nutrition and basic food security. </p>
		 <p> For all of these reasons, eradicating poverty in all of its manifestations requires the involvement of the entire international community. Therefore, this was chosen as SDG 1 by the United Nations (UN), whose 17 Sustainable Development Goals were approved in September 2015 as a component of the 2030 Agenda. </p>

        <h3>II.II Difference between Millenium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals 
</h3>
        <p> Global development planning and initiatives have evolved dramatically in the last few decades. With the introduction of the Millennium Development Goals (2000-2015) and the Sustainable Development Goals, there has been a shift from a fragmented approach to a more integrated and aligned strategy (2015-2030). </p>
        <p> The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which include precise objectives and benchmarks for eradicating the worst forms of human deprivation, served as a foundation for the success of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </p>
		<p> The eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which started in the year 2000 and ended in 2015, are essentially continued by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By virtually ending global ozone-depleting substance consumption, planting trees to counteract the loss of forests, and raising the percentage of total land and coastal marine areas globally, the MDGs, and specifically, goal seven, contributed to protecting the environment. </p>
		<p> Following the UN Millennium Summit and the UN Millennium Declaration of the same year, the United Nations developed and announced a set of eight goals known as the Millennium Development Goals in the year 2000. Around the world, progress on the eight goals was uneven at the time, with some nations making significant advancements and others making little to no progress. In order to continue fostering international cooperation for a better world, the UN updated the framework in 2015 and added the SDGs. </p>		<p> The Sustainable Development Goals are a group of 17 goals that the United Nations set forth in 2015 to lay out the course for global development over the ensuing 15 years, from now until 2030. </p>
		<p> The Sustainable Development Goals are a group of 17 goals that the United Nations set forth in 2015 to lay out the course for global development over the ensuing 15 years, from now until 2030. </p>
		<p> The MDGs were "halfway" goals, whereas the SDGs are "zero" goals. This last significant distinction also explains why impact strategies had to be modified and had to continue to change. </p>
		<p> The SDGs build on the momentum created by the MDGs by establishing an ambitious post-2015 development agenda that could cost more than $4 trillion per year. In contrast to the MDGs, which only received funding from governments and nonprofits, the SDGs also depend on contributions from the private sector to alter impractical and unsustainable consumption and production patterns. </p>
		<p> Overall, the SDGs have made only modest progress. The UN reports that many people are living healthier lives now than they did at the turn of the millennium. Nevertheless, representatives who attended meetings on sustainable development asserted that the SDGs are not being completed quickly enough or with enough momentum to meet the 2030 deadline. </p>

    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <h3>III.I Origin of the Sustainable Development Goal 1 “No Poverty”</h3>
 

<p>In September 2000, the United Nations Millennium Declaration committed 149 world leaders to combat hunger, disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation, discrimination against women, and poverty which are known as the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. The first goal of this project is to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. The objective is expected to halve the global poverty rate by 2015. Substantial progress has been made regarding the MDGs. The world has already realized the first MDG of halving the extreme poverty rate by 2015. </p>
 
<p>The MDGs are set to expire in 2015 and the discussion of a post-2015 agenda continues. The focus is now on building a sustainable world where environmental sustainability, social inclusion, and economic development are equally valued. In July 2014, the UN General Assembly Open Working Group (OWG) proposed a document containing 17 goals to be put forward for the General Assembly’s approval in September 2015. </p>

<p>This document set the ground for the new SDGs and the global development agenda spanning from 2015-2030. After that, On 25 September 2015, the 193 countries of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This comprehensive set of goals aims to “end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all” as part of a new development agenda. The first objective of the Millennium Development Goal is now separated into two different goals: ending poverty and ending hunger.</p>

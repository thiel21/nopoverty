The study demonstrated the exceptional efficacy of lemongrass oil in repelling fleas from dogs. A staggering 99% of the dogs treated with lemongrass oil experienced a significant reduction in flea infestation. This is a substantial improvement compared to traditional chemical-based flea treatments.

Key Findings:

High Efficacy: Lemongrass oil proved to be highly effective in eliminating fleas from dogs, significantly outperforming traditional chemical-based treatments.

Cost-Effective: The cost of lemongrass oil was significantly lower than commercially available flea medications, making it a more affordable option for pet owners.
Discussion and Conclusion
The results of this study provide strong evidence for the efficacy of lemongrass oil as a natural flea repellent for dogs in the Philippines. The high success rate observed in the treatment group suggests that lemongrass oil is a viable and effective alternative to traditional chemical-based flea control methods.

The findings also highlight the importance of exploring natural solutions for flea prevention, as they offer a safer and more environmentally friendly approach. The cost-effectiveness of lemongrass oil makes it an attractive option for pet owners seeking affordable flea control.

Further research is warranted to investigate the long-term efficacy of lemongrass oil, as well as its potential for use in combination with other natural flea repellents or preventative measures. This study provides a valuable contribution to the understanding of natural flea control methods and offers promising prospects for pet owners in the Philippines.
